### Hi I am Dipak ðŸ‘‹
I am a research data scientist with a Ph.D. in Nuclear Physics. I was born and raised in the foothill of the Himalayas in Eastern Nepal. Currently, I live in Indianapolis, IN.

- ðŸ”­ I work at The Bee Corp in Indianapolis, I build predictive models to assess bee colony strength using Infrared Imagery and real-time weather data.
- Before joining Bee Corp, I was a postdoctoral research scientist at the University of Florida, where I studied neutrino-nucleus interactions using data from the MINERvA detector.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently messing around with ChatGPT and other LLMs to develop an application for educational purposes.
